# 21 Days of Embedded Systems Programming

Welcome to **21 Days of Embedded Systems Programming**!  

This repository documents my daily progress and learnings as I explore core concepts in embedded systems - from basic electronics to microprocessor architecture and operations.

Each day focuses on a foundational topic, gradually building a strong understanding of embedded systems.
